//     {version: '3.19.0+2026-04-01', description: 'Settings dialog: all three columns (Setting, Default, Description) are now individually resizable by dragging the thin col-resize handle placed on the right edge of each sticky column header. The Setting column defaults to 500 px (up from 450 px) and the Default column defaults to 130 px; Description takes all remaining flex space. Column widths are persisted to GM storage under the key "<scriptId>-col-widths" and restored on next open alongside the dialog dimensions. Row cells are stamped with data-vz-settings-col="1" or "2" so _applyColWidth() can bulk-update them efficiently via querySelectorAll without touching any other element.'},
//     {version: '3.18.4+2026-04-01', description: 'settingsEscHandler: added a second case before the tryCloseDialog() fallback. When the active element is any INPUT or TEXTAREA inside the settings container (type=number, type=text in setting rows, sub-grid mb-pd-sub inputs, color-picker text inputs, keyboard-shortcut capture inputs) and is NOT the search field, Escape now only blurs the field (stopImmediatePropagation + preventDefault + blur) instead of closing the whole dialog. The dialog closes only when focus is on a non-input element such as a button, a section header, or the dialog container itself. The table-editor guard and search-field clear/blur logic are unchanged.'},
//     {version: '3.18.3+2026-04-01', description: '_openTableEditor Escape — root-cause fix. settingsEscHandler is a capture-phase listener on document and therefore always fires before any panel-level listener, making panel-side stopPropagation useless. Fix: added an early-return guard at the top of settingsEscHandler that checks document.querySelector("[id^=vz-tbl-editor-]") and returns immediately when that panel contains the active element (including when the panel itself is focused via tabIndex=0). With settingsEscHandler yielding, the panel keydown listener handles the two-step behaviour (Step 1: blur input → focus panel; Step 2: remove panel) using stopImmediatePropagation for safety.'},
//     {version: '3.18.2+2026-04-01', description: '_openTableEditor Escape — redesigned as a two-step panel-level handler. panel.tabIndex=0 makes the panel itself focusable; panel.focus() is called after appending to DOM so Escape works immediately. The keydown listener is on the panel element, not document, so it only fires when focus is inside the panel and settingsEscHandler is never involved. Step 1: if focus is on a text input inside the panel, blur it and move focus to the panel (second Escape will then close). Step 2: if focus is on the panel itself, remove the panel (equivalent to Close button). e.stopPropagation() in both steps prevents the event from bubbling to any parent handler.'},
//     {version: '3.18.1+2026-04-01', description: '_openTableEditor Escape fix: the handler now checks panel.contains(document.activeElement) before intercepting. Escape is only captured when focus is inside the vz-tbl-editor panel; if focus is elsewhere (e.g. in the parent settings dialog search field) the event is left to propagate so settingsEscHandler can act on it normally. Fixes: pressing Escape outside the table editor closed both dialogs instead of only the settings one.'},
//     {version: '3.18.0+2026-04-01', description: '_openTableEditor: Escape key now closes only the table-editor panel instead of the parent settings dialog. A capture-phase keydown listener (_tblEscHandler) is registered on document when the panel opens; it calls stopImmediatePropagation() and e.preventDefault() before removing the panel, so settingsEscHandler never receives the event. The listener self-removes when the panel is closed (either via Escape, the ✕ header button, or the footer Close button), with a MutationObserver as an additional safety net that removes any stale listener if the panel node is removed through any other path.'},
//     {version: '3.17.0+2026-03-31', description: 'Three improvements to the Settings dialog UI for color-related configuration entries: (1) popup_dialog sub-inputs: when a configSchema entry of type popup_dialog declares a colorFields array (e.g. colorFields: [\'bg\', \'color\']), those named sub-fields now render with a live color-preview background on the text input (matching getContrastYIQ contrast logic) and a 🎨 picker button. Clicking the 🎨 button opens the shared iro.js pickerContainer positioned below the button; selecting a color updates the sub-input value, its background preview, and syncs the master hidden input. The preview is also applied on initial render and kept in sync as the user types. (2) Reset logic extended: when resetting a popup_dialog entry whose default parts include color sub-fields, the color preview (background + contrast text color) and 🎨 button background are also reset. (3) Overlay click guard updated: the isPickerBtn test now also matches elements inside [data-pd-picker-for] so clicking a sub-grid picker button never incorrectly closes the dialog.'},
//     {version: '3.16.0+2026-03-27', description: 'Two new config entry types: (1) type:\'function\' — renders a 🔧 button labelled with cfg.label; clicking it calls functionRegistry[cfg.default]() passed in via Lib.showSettings({ functionRegistry: {...} }). Skipped in takeSnapshot, hasUnsavedChanges, save, and reset loops. (2) type:\'table\' — renders a 📋 Edit button; clicking it opens a draggable table-editor panel (_openTableEditor) for the named table. The panel supports add/edit/delete of rows stored as [[col0, col1, ...], ...] in GM_setValue(key). Rows are retrieved via the new Lib.getTableRows(key, defaultRows) public API method. showModal() now accepts a functionRegistry parameter (defaulting to {} when absent). Save/snapshot/reset loops now skip types [\'divider\',\'function\',\'table\']. Also fixed: LIBRARY_VERSION constant was not updated with the @version bump — corrected to 3.16.0+2026-03-27.'},
//     {version: '3.15.0+2026-03-27', description: 'showSettings() public API now accepts an optional opts object with a functionRegistry map ({ \'fnName\': fn, ... }) so consumer scripts can register callable functions for type:\'function\' config entries. Previously showModal() took no arguments and functionRegistry was always undefined in the event-binding code, causing function-type buttons to silently fail. The opts parameter is forwarded to showModal() via settingsInterface.showModal(opts?.functionRegistry || {}).'},
//     {version: '3.14.3+2026-03-04', description: 'Fix two regressions introduced in 3.14.0: (1) Changelog CLOSE link was made conditional (clearing the filter instead of closing when text was present) which broke the link entirely in some code paths. Reverted to unconditional closeDialog() — CLOSE always closes the dialog regardless of filter state. (2) Changelog Escape handler had a spurious third branch that intercepted Escape when the search field was not focused but had text, clearing the filter instead of closing the dialog. Removed that branch. Correct behaviour is now: Escape while search is focused + has text → clear filter; Escape while search is focused + empty → blur field; Escape while search is not focused → close the dialog unconditionally.'},
//     {version: '3.14.0+2026-03-04', description: 'Four UX improvements across Settings and Changelog dialogs: (1) Changelog — red ✕ clear button: a small red ✕ button is appended inside the "🔍 Filter changelog entries…" input (position:absolute, right-aligned). It appears when the field has text and disappears when cleared. Clicking it (or pressing Escape, per existing behaviour) wipes the filter and re-focuses the input. (2) Changelog — CLOSE link smart behaviour: CLOSE no longer unconditionally closes the dialog. When the search field has text, CLOSE now clears the filter (identical to clicking ✕) instead of dismissing the dialog; the dialog closes only when the field is already empty. (3) Changelog — Escape when search is not focused: previously Escape always closed the dialog when the search input was not focused. Now, if the search field has text and is NOT focused, Escape clears the filter (cases 1–3 in clEscHandler) and focuses the input; closing only happens when the field is already empty. (4) Settings — red ✕ clear button: same ✕ button pattern added to the "🔍 Search settings…" input. Clicking it clears the field and triggers the input event (identical to the existing Escape-key behaviour). Search highlighting in settings rows: the settings search handler now highlights the needle in each matching row (label text in col1 via .vz-setting-label, default value in col2, description text in col3) using the same yellow <mark> highlight span as the Changelog. Row data attributes (data-vz-label, data-vz-desc, data-vz-default) are written at build time so the search handler can restore original plain text when the filter is cleared without touching the input widgets (checkboxes, color pickers, etc.) inside col1.'},
//     {version: '3.13.1+2026-02-26', description: 'Fix color picker opening at black when the stored/default color value is a CSS named color (e.g. "green"). iro.js v5 does not accept CSS named colors as its color initialisation option and silently falls back to #000000. Fix: added cssColorToHex() helper that resolves any CSS color value to a 6-digit hex string by writing it to a temporary off-screen element and parsing the browser-computed rgb() result. cssColorToHex() is called in the color picker button onclick handler to normalise the value before passing it to new iro.ColorPicker(). This is a defensive library-level fix; consumer scripts should also use hex defaults (see ShowAllEntityData 9.97.9).'},
//     {version: '3.13.0+2026-02-24', description: 'Four fixes: (1) Changelog and Settings focus-on-open: replaced requestAnimationFrame double-rAF with setTimeout(..., 200) — rAF fires while the browser is still processing the GM-menu-close event which has stolen page focus; the 200ms delay lets the browser return focus to the page before the focus() call is made. (2) Settings search input now focused on open (was missing entirely). (3) lib_content_font_family added to _LIB_PREFS_DEFAULTS and _libPrefs; applied to Changelog container fontFamily; exposed in Library Settings editor as a second field. (4) Both lib_content_font_size and lib_content_font_family are now part of the libPrefs public API so consumer scripts (e.g. App Help dialog in ShowAllEntityData) can read them via Lib.libPrefs.'},
//     {version: '3.12.0+2026-02-24', description: 'Fix Escape key handling in Settings and Changelog dialogs; add Changelog search focus on open; add Library Settings editor; apply lib_content_font_size to Changelog dialog. (1) Escape root-cause fix: both search inputs changed from type="search" to type="text" — browsers natively intercept Escape on type=search inputs, clearing the value before the keydown event fires so the "has text" branch could never trigger. (2) Settings Escape handler: added with capture:true (fires before bubble-phase handlers) and stored as a named reference (settingsEscHandler) so it can be removed when the dialog closes; closeDialog() now also calls document.removeEventListener(..., true) to prevent accumulation across multiple opens. (3) Changelog Escape handler: replaced anonymous window.addEventListener (never cleaned up, accumulates on every open) with a named reference (clEscHandler) added via document.addEventListener(..., true); closeDialog() removes it. Both handlers use stopImmediatePropagation() to block competing handlers when the search field is focused. (4) Changelog focus: changed from entriesWrap.focus() to searchInput.focus() in the double-rAF so the filter field is ready for input immediately after opening. Escape on an empty search field now blurs it and refocuses entriesWrap so keyboard scroll keys continue to work. (5) Library Settings editor: new libSettingsInterface.show() opens a small dialog registered as a "🔧 Library Settings" GM menu item, with a fields[] array that is trivially extensible. Saves to GM storage key "vz-lib-prefs". (6) _libPrefs / _LIB_PREFS_DEFAULTS: developer-editable defaults at the top of the module; lib_content_font_size (default "1.05em") is applied to the Changelog container font-size so all relative em sizes scale automatically.'},
//     {version: '3.11.0+2026-02-24', description: 'Three fixes across Settings and Changelog dialogs: (1) Escape-key in filter fields: when the search/filter input is focused, first Escape clears the text and re-dispatches an input event (so filtered content resets live); second Escape (field now empty) blurs the field; only when the field is not focused does Escape close the dialog. Applies to both the Settings search input and the Changelog search input. (2) Resize-then-release-outside no longer closes the dialog: added didResize flag (mirrors existing didDrag flag), set to true on first mousemove while isResizing; overlay click/mousedown handler skips close and resets the flag when it is set; flag is reset to false on each new resize-handle mousedown. Applied to both Settings (overlay click handler) and Changelog (overlay mousedown handler). (3) Resize cursor lock and text-selection suppression: on resize-handle mousedown a temporary <style> tag is injected into <head> with "* { cursor: nwse-resize !important; user-select: none !important; }" so the cursor never jumps to a different shape and no text is accidentally selected while dragging; the style tag is removed on mouseup. Each dialog uses a unique style element id to avoid conflicts.'},
//     {version: '3.10.0+2026-02-24', description: 'Four improvements: (1) Changelog dialog: removed "CLOSE" button at bottom-right (redundant with CLOSE link and Escape key); scrollable entries area made focusable (tabIndex=0, mouseenter→focus) so ↑↓/PageUp/PageDown/Home/End work natively; double-rAF focus on open so Escape works immediately. (2) Changelog search highlighting: highlightNeedle() helper wraps matches in <mark style="background:#fff176">; applied to version, date, section label, and all item text via renderItem(); needle threaded through the recursion. (3) Changelog meta line: _visibleCount closure variable tracks entries visible after each buildContent() call; updateMetaLine() now emits "(N filtered)" in bold when a filter is active and the visible count differs from the total. (4) Settings AND changelog drag-then-release-outside bug fixed: didDrag flag set on first mousemove while isDragging; overlay click/mousedown handler skips tryCloseDialog()/closeDialog() and resets didDrag when the flag is set, preventing the drag-end event from closing the dialog.'},
//     {version: '3.9.5+2026-02-24', description: 'Widen settings column 1 ("Setting") from 280px to 450px in both the sticky column-header row and the data rows, so that long labels and inline widgets (buttons, inputs) no longer wrap to a second line.'},
//     {version: '3.9.4+2026-02-24', description: 'Fix settings column-header alignment: the sticky "Setting / Default / Description" header row was nested inside the drag-header div which carries 18px left/right padding, making it 36px narrower than the settings rows that live outside that padding. Fix: moved the column-header div out of drag-header and made it a direct flex-sibling between drag-header and settings-body at full container width. Removed border-radius and margin-top from the header row; replaced the all-sides border with explicit left/right/bottom borders to match the settings-body side borders.'},
//     {version: '3.9.3+2026-02-24', description: 'Fix settings row layout: definitive fix for display:flex being stripped. The rendered HTML confirmed display:flex was absent from the computed style even with single-line style attributes. Root cause: Tampermonkey userscript sandbox innerHTML assignment sanitizes certain CSS display values. Fix: setting rows are now built entirely as real DOM elements using document.createElement() + Object.assign(el.style, ...) / el.style.cssText, collected in a DocumentFragment, and appended to #settings-body after container.innerHTML establishes the shell. display:flex set via el.style.display = "flex" in JS cannot be stripped by any HTML parser or content-script sanitizer.'},
//     {version: '3.9.2+2026-02-24', description: 'Fix settings row layout still stacking vertically: collapsed all three column div style attributes to single-line strings and removed overflow-x:hidden from #settings-body.'},
//     {version: '3.9.1+2026-02-24', description: 'Fix two bugs in the 3.9.0 settings modal rewrite: (1) Color picker (iro.js) swatch button did nothing — picker popup was positioned using btn.offsetTop/offsetLeft which are relative to the offset-parent through the scrollable body div; replaced with getBoundingClientRect()-based coordinates relative to container so popup appears directly below the swatch button. (2) Setting rows rendered vertically stacked instead of side-by-side — vz-setting-row flex container lacked flex-wrap:nowrap so columns wrapped; added explicit nowrap and min-width:0 on all three column divs.'},
//     {version: '3.9.0+2026-02-24', description: 'Two changes: (1) Changelog dialog renderer updated from newRenderer.js: renderItem() is now recursive for arbitrary nesting depth; buildContent() accepts an optional filter string for live search; a search input is added to the drag-header. Force-refresh respects the current search filter when re-rendering. (2) Settings modal completely rewritten from table-based layout to a modern flex/div-based card layout to eliminate the ghost shadow/white-row glitch that appeared when collapsing section headers. The ghost was caused by table row height calculations leaking into the scrollable area. The new layout uses div-based section cards with smooth CSS transitions; all features preserved: collapsible sections, draggable/resizable dialog, color picker, keyboard shortcut capture, popup_dialog sub-editor, search, global reset, and unsaved-change detection.'},
//     {version: '3.8.0+2026-02-23', description: 'Changelog dialog renderer rewritten: structured Markdown-inspired layout (## version, ### section, - items with sub-items). buildContent() now accepts an optional filter string parameter for live search. A search input is added to the drag-header so users can type to filter entries in real time. Force-refresh handler respects the current search filter when re-rendering. renderItem() is recursive for arbitrary nesting depth.'},
//     {version: '3.7.0+2026-02-23', description: 'Changelog dialog renderer rewritten: replaced the flat <table>-based layout (version / description columns) with a document-style <div> layout that renders each entry as a version+date header block followed by labelled section groups (🚀 Improvements, 🐛 Fixes, 🧹 Cleanup, ⚙️ Internal, etc.) with <ul> bullet lists and optional nested sub-lists. Both the new {version, date, sections[{label, items[]}]} JSON format and the legacy flat {version, description} string format are handled — legacy entries render as a plain paragraph for backward compat. buildRows() renamed to buildContent(); tbody reference replaced with entriesEl; force-refresh handler updated accordingly.'},
//     {version: '3.6.0+2026-02-23', description: 'Changelog dialog and app-help dialog: debug/info logging added to report cache status (source: static / cache / fresh, entry count, cache age in seconds) every time the respective popup is opened. A "🔄 Force refresh" link is added to the upper-right header of both dialogs; clicking it bypasses the cache, re-fetches from GitHub, updates the in-memory data and re-renders the content in place without closing the dialog. Force-refresh success / failure is logged at info/warn level and reflected in the UI. fetchCachedText gains an optional fourth parameter forceRefresh (default false) that, when true, skips the cache-hit check and goes straight to the network. _changelogMeta object tracks {fromCache, fetchedAt, url, cacheKey, cacheTtlMs} for the last changelog load so that changelogInterface.show() can report accurate cache status.'},
//     {version: '3.5.0+2026-02-23', description: 'Added showCustomDialog / showCustomAlert / showCustomConfirm to the library public API for reuse across consumer scripts. The settings modal now guards against accidental data loss: (1) Escape key, the CLOSE link, and backdrop clicks first check for unsaved changes via a snapshot comparison and present a showCustomConfirm prompt before discarding edits; (2) the RESET link always presents a showCustomConfirm prompt that warns the user all configuration settings will be reset to their default values before proceeding.'},
